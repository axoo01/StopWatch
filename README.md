# Modern Stopwatch
A luxurious stopwatch I built to dive deep into advanced CSS and JavaScript, learning to craft elegant, interactive web apps

## What I Learned
- Creating smooth start, pause, lap, and reset functions with JavaScript animations
- Exploring dark/light mode toggles using local storage for a seamless user experience
- Experimenting with a gold and charcoal palette and glassmorphism for a premium, modern design
- Building responsive layouts to work flawlessly across devices
- Adding lap history with hover effects to enhance interactivity and polish

## Tech Stack
- **HTML/CSS**: Learned glassmorphism, metallic animations, and elegant typography with Inter and IBM Plex Mono fonts
- **JavaScript**: Practiced object-oriented programming, local storage, and event handling
- **Font Awesome**: Used minimal icons to improve UI without clutter
